#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>
1.Set up the experiment: To determine the variation of magnetic field with the distance along the axis of a current carrying coil, you will need a current carrying coil, a compass, and a ruler.<br>
2. Measure the magnetic field: Place the compass in various positions along the axis of the coil, starting from the center and moving towards the edge. Record the reading on the compass at each position.<br>
3. Plot the data: Plot the magnetic field readings against the distance along the axis of the coil.<br>
4. Determine the relationship between magnetic field and distance: Based on the data, determine the relationship between magnetic field and distance along the axis of the coil. This relationship will give you the variation of magnetic field with the distance.<br>
5. Estimate the radius of the coil: Based on the relationship between magnetic field and distance, you can estimate the radius of the coil by using the formula for magnetic field from a current carrying coil.<br>
6. Repeat the experiment: Repeat the experiment to verify the accuracy of the results and to make sure that the radius of the coil is consistent.<br>
7. Repeat the experiment: Repeat the experiment to verify the accuracy of the results and to make sure that the radius of the coil is consistent.<br>
8. Analyze the results: Analyze the results to determine if the variation of magnetic field with distance along the axis of a current carrying coil is as expected. If not, consider possible sources of error and try to improve the experiment.<br>
###### Assessment Method: 
To determine the variation of magnetic field with the distance along the axis of a current carrying coil, we can use the formula for magnetic field due to a solenoid (current carrying coil):<br><br>
 B = μ₀ * n * I / L, where<br><br>
B is magnetic field strength<br>
μ₀ is the permeability of free space<br>
n is the number of turns per unit length<br>
I is the current<br>
L is the length of the coil<br><br>
We can calculate the magnetic field strength for different distances along the axis of the coil and plot a graph to visualize the variation.<br><br>
To estimate the radius of the coil, we can use the formula for magnetic field due to a single turn of wire:<br><br>
B = μ₀ * I / (2 * π * r), where<br><br>
B is magnetic field strength<br>
μ₀ is the permeability of free space<br>
I is the current<br>
r is the radius of the wire<br><br>
By comparing the magnetic field strength due to a solenoid and a single turn of wire, we can solve for the radius of the coil.

<u> <b>Description: </b>    </u>
<br>
The magnetic field along the axis of a current carrying coil is proportional to the current and the number of turns in the coil. It decreases with increasing distance from the center of the coil due to the inverse square law. This means that the magnetic field decreases with the square of the distance from the center of the coil.<br><br>
To estimate the radius of the coil, we need to measure the magnetic field at a given distance from the center of the coil. We can do this by using a Gaussmeter or any other device that measures magnetic fields. By measuring the magnetic field at different distances, we can plot the variation of magnetic field with distance. From the plot, we can determine the radius of the coil as the distance at which the magnetic field falls to half of its maximum value.<br><br>
For example, if the maximum magnetic field is measured at the center of the coil to be B0, then at a distance r from the center, the magnetic field will be B0/2. By equating these two values and solving for r, we can determine the radius of the coil.<br><br>
In conclusion, the magnetic field along the axis of a current carrying coil decreases with increasing distance from the center of the coil. The radius of the coil can be estimated by measuring the magnetic field at different distances and plotting the variation with distance, and determining the distance at which the magnetic field falls to half of its maximum value.
