<b> Experiment|     <b> To determine the variation of magnetic field with the distance along the axis of a current carrying coil and estimate the radius of the coil

### About the Experiment 

The magnetic field produced by a current-carrying coil is proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the center of the coil. By measuring the magnetic field at different distances along the axis of the coil, one can determine the variation of the magnetic field with distance and estimate the radius of the coil. This information can be useful in applications such as electromagnets, transformers, and induction motors.
