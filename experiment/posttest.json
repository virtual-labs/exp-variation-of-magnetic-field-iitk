        "d": "Using an oscillograph"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A compass detects the presence and direction of a magnetic field. By placing a compass at various distances along the axis of a current-carrying coil and observing the deflection of the needle, you can determine the relative strength of the magnetic field at each point. This allows you to understand how the field strength varies with distance.",
        "b": "A voltmeter measures voltage, not magnetic fields. While voltage can be indirectly related to magnetic fields in some electromagnetic devices, it's not suitable for directly measuring the variation of a magnetic field.",
        "c": "These instruments are primarily used for analyzing electrical signals that vary over time. While a changing magnetic field can induce a current in a conductor, an oscilloscope wouldn't be the most efficient tool for directly measuring the spatial variation of the magnetic field itself.",
